***EVERY FILE IS TO USE ON YOUR OWN RISK!*** It could switch your settings or even break the game for you!
Make sure to have -exec autoexec.cfg in your steam startup for the settings to work.

To use the scrim setting you need to also have the unpracc.cfg in your CS2 cfg folder. (bcs it launches unpracc.cfg at the beginning)

I usually update the config online immediately when i change something.

ONLY DOWNLOAD THE CONFIG FROM THIS GITHUB ACCOUNT! huhucs TO MAKE SURE IT'S VIRUSFREE!
